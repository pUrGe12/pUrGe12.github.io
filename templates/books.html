        <h1>Books</h1>
        <p>I have written about some of them in more depth (depends on which ones have enough depth to write about). I try to extract meaning from each book I read, but obviously it doesn't really work out that well. So, a I figured a better way is to sometimes appreciate that too.</p>

        <h2>Some series</h2>

        <h3>Rick Riordan</h3>

        <p>I have to start with him because I have read <strong>every single book</strong> in the <code>Percy Jackson</code> universe. This includes</p>

        <ul>
          <li>☑ Percy Jackson series - 5</li>
          <li>☑ Heros of Olympus series - 5</li>
          <li>☑ Kane Chronicles - 3</li>
          <li>☑ Trails of Apollo - 5</li>
          <li>☑ Magnus Chase - 3</li>
          <li>☑ Greeks heroes and gods - 2</li>
          <li>☑ A few latest releases (though I did not like them much, might also be because I am older now)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All thanks to this dude. He really kickstarted my reading journey back in the days (when I was 12 or so)</p>

        <h3>Geronimo Stilton</h3>

        <p>I believe any list will be incomplete without mentioning this mouse. Everyone I know has at some point in their lives read about this dude. I have read something like 20 books in this, I don't even remember the names now, but I can recall the feeling of opening up my cupboard just to see all these GS books looking back at me!</p>

        <h3>Assassin's creed</h3>

        <p>Yeah I read the book before I played the games. I read only 4 of these though:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>☑ Renaissance (That's Ezio's story before he's old)</li>
          <li>☑ Brotherhood (That's a continuation)</li>
          <li>☑ The Secret Crusade (Personal favourite, Altair's story)</li>
          <li>☑ Revelations (That's when Ezio dies :()</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's all for series I guess. I read some <code>science books</code> as well! Yeahh, it was a good passtime.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>☑ Stephen Hawking - A Brief History of Time (was possibly the first science book I bought and I understood jackshit back then)</li>
          <li>☑ Michio Kaku - Parallel Worlds (Some mind-twisting stuff inside that, but I was slowly getting a hang of it)</li>
          <li>☑ Stephen Hawking - Brief Answers to Big Questions (this was still a doable read because of my "experience" now)</li>
          <li>☑ James Glieck - Chaos (A beautifully complex book, took me a while to finish, and even longer to understand what I had just read)</li>
          <li>☑ Manjit Kumar - Quantum (Introduced me to quantum mechanics like no other book could ever. I felt like I was living with Bohr)</li>
          <li>☑ Joshua Foer - Moonwalking with Einstein (Initially I was skeptical about the name but it's a very good and a new t idea which I still could bring to fruition)</li>
          <li>☑ Daniel Kahneman - Thinking fast and slow (I mean, who hasn't read this. But the real question is, do you use anchor theory in your life? If not, do it. It's awesome)</li>
          <li>☑ Richard Feynman - Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman (Haha, fuck up, but own it, and recover. Man really liked to live)</li>
          <li>☑ Steven Strogatz - The joy of X (Thanks to 3b1b who introduced me to him after an interview. This is pretty much a chill and fun book, nothing serious)</li>
          <li>☑ Yuval Noah Harari - Sapiens (A nice and long history of everything we've done right and wrong. I love how blunt he is!)</li>
          <li>☑ Richard Dawkins - The Selfish Gene (My first book on evolutionary biology and boy it was done right)</li>
          <li>☑ <strong>Roger Penrose</strong> - <strong>The Emperor's New Mind</strong> (The one book which sparked my interest in computer science, and everything in it. What a man!)</li>
          <li>☑ Yuval Noah Harari - Homo Deus (Some good ideas. By this time, I had learnt some things that I could have opinions of my own and challenge some of his)</li>
        </ul>
