## The Book

**Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius is the private journal of the Roman Emperor, never intended for publication. Written during his military campaigns, it offers a window into the mind of one of history's most powerful men grappling with the same questions we all face.

## Key Takeaways

It's a different type of book. You can't read it like a novel or you end up losing its brilliance.
