## The Book

**Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius is the private journal of the Roman Emperor, never intended for publication. Written during his military campaigns, it offers a window into the mind of one of history's most powerful men grappling with the same questions we all face.

## Why I Read It

Given that I named my website "Musings" directly inspired by this book, it felt only fitting to put this here first. Aurelius writes with brutal honesty to himself—reminding himself to be patient, to focus on what he can control, and to accept the transience of life.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on what you can control** - Your thoughts and actions are yours; everything else is not.
2. **The obstacle is the way** - Every difficulty is an opportunity for growth.
3. **Memento mori** - Remember death, not to be morbid, but to live fully.

## Favorite Quote

> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

## Rating

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - A timeless classic that I return to often.
