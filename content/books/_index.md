I have written about some of them in more depth (depends on which ones have enough depth to write about). I try to extract meaning from each book I read, but obviously it doesn't really work out that well. So, a I figured a better way is to sometimes appreciate that too.

## Some series

### Rick Riordan

I have to start with him because I have read **every single book** in the `Percy Jackson` universe. This includes

- [x] Percy Jackson series - 5
- [x] Heros of Olympus series - 5
- [x] Kane Chronicles - 3
- [x] Trails of Apollo - 5
- [x] Magnus Chase - 3
- [x] Greeks heroes and gods - 2
- [x] A few latest releases (though I did not like them much, might also be because I am older now)

All thanks to this dude. He really kickstarted my reading journey back in the days (when I was 12 or so)

### Geronimo Stilton

I believe any list will be incomplete without mentioning this mouse. Everyone I know has at some point in their lives read about this dude. I have read something like 20 books in this, I don't even remember the names now, but I can recall the feeling of opening up my cupboard just to see all these GS books looking back at me!

### Assassin's creed

Yeah I read the book before I played the games. I read only 4 of these though:

- [x] Renaissance (That's Ezio's story before he's old)
- [x] Brotherhood (That's a continuation)
- [x] The Secret Crusade (Personal favourite, Altair's story)
- [x] Revelations (That's when Ezio dies :()

That's all for series I guess. I read some `science books` as well! Yeahh, it was a good passtime.

- [x] Stephen Hawking - A Brief History of Time (was possibly the first science book I bought and I understood jackshit back then)
- [x] Michio Kaku - Parallel Worlds (Some mind-twisting stuff inside that, but I was slowly getting a hang of it)
- [x] Stephen Hawking - Brief Answers to Big Questions (this was still a doable read because of my "experience" now)
- [x] James Glieck - Chaos (A beautifully complex book, took me a while to finish, and even longer to understand what I had just read)
- [x] Manjit Kumar - Quantum (Introduced me to quantum mechanics like no other book could ever. I felt like I was living with Bohr)
- [x] Joshua Foer - Moonwalking with Einstein (Initially I was skeptical about the name but it's a very good and a new t idea which I still could bring to fruition)
- [x] Daniel Kahneman - Thinking fast and slow (I mean, who hasn't read this. But the real question is, do you use anchor theory in your life? If not, do it. It's awesome)
- [x] Richard Feynman - Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman (Haha, fuck up, but own it, and recover. Man really liked to live)
- [x] Steven Strogatz - The joy of X (Thanks to 3b1b who introduced me to him after an interview. This is pretty much a chill and fun book, nothing serious)
- [x] Yuval Noah Harari - Sapiens (A nice and long history of everything we've done right and wrong. I love how blunt he is!)
- [x] Richard Dawkins - The Selfish Gene (My first book on evolutionary biology and boy it was done right)
- [x] **Roger Penrose** - **The Emperor's New Mind** (The one book which sparked my interest in computer science, and everything in it. What a man!)
- [x] Yuval Noah Harari - Homo Deus (Some good ideas. By this time, I had learnt some things that I could have opinions of my own and challenge some of his)
