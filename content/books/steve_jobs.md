## The Book

This is a biography on Steve Jobs and `Isaac Walterson`, praise the heavens for sending this man to write about other people's lives. He's an insanely good author and this book was a big turning point in my life (maybe I just happened to read it during a turn, whatever).

Here's what I got to know about Steve Jobs:

1. He was a self made man, with the help of Woz obviously
2. He knew how to sell (like extremely well)
3. He could talk to people in a way that positioned him above them (it was very important that he did that)
4. He was manipulative (and he got it to work for him)

Basically, an evil-genius-who-did-good sort of story man. You can imagine the sort of `emotions` (haha, used the 'e' word) that would be running in you when you read such a thing!
