Personally I don't support completely discrediting someone's work even if they couldn't articulate it well on paper or at all. Its alright, I know I am guilty of it myself sometimes when I am not able to solve a problem and I ramble on. Thats fine, that makes us humans. I think the idea of steve jobs completely obliterating a person over their mistakes is a special case of victory than a norm. Maybe out of 100 times, it works once and when it does, it makes wonders, but I think being compassionate works much more often. Its just that being extremely brutal is so rare that when it works, people hail it, while quitely ignoring the good work compassionate people have always been doing. What do you think

I think i hold this principle in me that says inherently no one wants to be a failure and when presented with a chance, people do jump. But some make it, maybe its the law of averages or luck or hardwork whatever, but I don't think anyone is willingly going to sabotage their own lives. Now it gets harder to justify this thought when talking about criminals. 

I read about the dark triad and I was deeply interested. I like to think of myself as sometimes machiavellian, that I will purposefully deceive others for personal gains, and I have done that. But I believe everyone falls in some or the other level of the dark triad. Very few are truly altruistic. Its hard to be, especially when the world doesn't reciprocate your kindness and instead tends to use you (people like me I suppose then). But then, I don't know if this is wrong or right, to me it feels natural that in a place where no one has any idea whatsoever about what their purpose in life is, and what they are here for, being selfish seems more natural than being altruistic. 

Why not work for yourself, because you can feel your emotions and you can feel your pain much more easily than anyone else's. Yet if we take this narrative into account that idea of an anchor at 5, the idea that most people are somewhat compassonate is suddenly weird because why? It gives you no benefits and you can gain a leverage over that person you're grading. I think its a profound idea that even if people want to gain an upper hand over their peers, unless there is a clear path to that, there is no need to be bad. I mean, why sabotage a relation when you can play along and get a deeper insight into that person before finally breaking off. 

Speaking of deeper insights, I don't think most people have an idea about their own insights, about their own principles and ideologies. I mean heck, I don't think people have "values" and "code" that they live by anymore. It might not be necessary nowadays but a person without "principles" to me is basically not a person anymore, he's merely a product of consumerism and being moulded by the society to fit certain ideas, his ideas are their ideas, his thoughts are their thoughts, his beliefs are found by what he reads online or from a spiritual leader. No one takes time to sit for themselves and think for themselves and form morals and values and principles for themselves. In such a world, do you really think compassion comes from inherent human goodness or just what they are being to do by society? Is it that "humans are good" or that "humans who are commanded by 'god/society/media' are good"? Its just sad because I know, I have seen people's views being distorted by these "influencers". What a fucking bad word! I mean, people willingly get "influenced" and find nothing wrong in that! This is bullshit! I don't know how this got so normalized but since it is, no one finds their own place anymore, its just fitting into whatever the society/world has carved for them. No ability to shapeshift because all that power lies with their social media stars. 

What's the point if the world in which I live degrades to a point in which people are happily calling out for wars, people are happily committing atrocious crimes, people are happily engaging in other's affairs. 

See I understand we like being told what to do, but again, is it something we learn or something we're born with? I know children don't like being told what to do. They do their own shit, even fight back in times when their freedom is distrubed, and yet as the world grows complex it seems like there is no choice but to succumb to someone else, someone more experienced and that's when this influencer thing happens. 

Think about it, what are you always told when you're growing up? You should to so and so person, be it a teacher, a parent, an adult because they know more than you. That is true, its fine, its probably the only way to even educate a child, but I think the side effects of this is inevitably a world in which minds are so feebly that even a 20 second video about someone can completely change views. Some people like Adam Grant argue that a flexible mind is better, and I agree but in what fucking context? A flexible mind in his case is one that is open to change based on "proper evidence, right circumstances and moral goodness". 

I won't talk about morality but honestly its again a made up construct, but proper evidence and right circumstances are rarely presented by these influencers! In a place where people don't even have principles to live by, whats worse is when their views are dictated by someone else, subjected to change by someone else and that too in a matter of seconds. Why do you think violence is rampart in the world today? Earlier it was religious wars, expansion wars. 

They were because of the people principles albeit bold and often incorrect ones, but today? Today wars aren't on princples they are on fucking beliefs. Beliefs that are subjected to change by a single word, a single video, a single person. What use this belief? What use this war?
