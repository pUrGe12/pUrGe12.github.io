# On the Game of Life

This was the title of a paper I was trying to get published to a math `interest` magazine in my college. Unfortunately they had a strict page limit (of 2 pages which is ridiculous) and though I fought for it to be changed, they never did concede. Hence, I am writing about it here! 

(This is I from 2025 Jan, a year has passed and I have learnt more on the topic, however I won't make any changes here cause I am too lazy)

## Introduction

On October 1970, Martin Gardner described the brainchild of John Conway called Life, a Cellular Automaton played on an infinite grid with no players. This paper aims to serve as a guide in this field providing some elementary mathematics behind such systems and discuss some applications of the Game of Life.
