> When you feel hurt, remember that day
> you were never asked, you were never called
> When people near you basked, in a light that seemed
> to take all it all; from your eyes,
> and ping your ears,
> listening to their glorious fame
> and hanging your head in shame.

> Death will come and take them away
> like any other in the fields of hay
> or daffodils, or dandelions or rye
> he doesn't seem to care about the place you reside

> Pain, dear you are to the mind. I didn't realise,
> I cried.
> I thought I was being left behind,
> lost in the light of the others beside.
> Now when I feel hurt I remember that
> remembrance is small and so is to be free,
> I may not be enough, but I am enough to be me
