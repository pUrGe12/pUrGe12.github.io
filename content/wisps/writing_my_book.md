I think all of life is either to be, or to be better. I wanna be better. Cause, who remembers the averages? I think of this quote whenever I get the chance

> If you don't use your voice, you're halfway to the fields of Asphodel already

Yeah, I know it's a children's book but if you think about it, there isn't a truer statement that this in this world. The ordinary dead reside in the fields of Asphodel, unable to speak and think, just wander aimlessly, probably what they did during life as well. With that being said, I can't imagine why anyone would choose such a life. Why be ordinary when you can be great. 

I wanna write a book, I have been thinking of ideas, its a novel but more like how Kafka and Dostoevsky used to write, but I don't want to copy that style. That would defeat the entire purpose of the exercise. I have my own views that I want to share, I know its unique, I just don't know if I have it in me.

> If it doesn't come bursting out of you, don't do it

Bukowski may have been a genius, but he can't be more wrong about this. I don't think I would've been here if not for delibrate practise, it never comes bursting for then you would never have to worry about it and the best artists are born of worry.
