# Along the misty shade of river gray

> Blessed are those who seek nothing,
> free of will and will power.
> While I lay thinking and clutching,
> To that one bright sunflower, that I found,
> in my search
>
> Hopeful are those who feel nothing,
> Numb as a river fed with scum.
> Here I am, across the river gray running,
> the petals of my flower becoming drunk,
> while vultures nearby perch
> 
> Happy are those who dream nothing,
> Their goals all achieved and done.
> Looking across I can see the burning, of what
> was a garden I intended to save overturn.
> Along the misty shade of river gray,
> I lay, with a yellow tape.
> That is my life now, my only merch.

I could sit here and anaylse this for hours because there is a lot of things I wanted to convey and believe it or not, this came on the spot `while` I was creating this blog page. I had written a poem with the same title once before but it was a very different structure. I am myself amazed.
