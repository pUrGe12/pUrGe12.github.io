I am usually not the one to get motion sickness while travelling but I just realised why that might happen in the first place. Note that I am not a biologist and I have done absolutely no research to backup the claims I am going to make now. This is what I experienced and you are free to take it with a grain of salt (pun intended, as you will see).

So, before sitting in the bus for a 9 hour journey, I had a homemade, cocoa rich, dark chocolate with honey fillings. That was only good part because then in the bus I started feeling extremely light-headed and my stomach was acting weird (I had a lot of food before that...). 

Then I realised that for neurons to pass signals around, they need to transfer ions through the synaptic cleft which are mostly sodium and calcium. Now eating small amounts of chocolate by itself cannot hamper the ion concentration in the body, but IDK why in my case it did. Cause as soon as I had a bunch of those `yellow` lays with a lot of salts, it made me feel extremely better.

So, carry salt with you and chug it down. It helps.
