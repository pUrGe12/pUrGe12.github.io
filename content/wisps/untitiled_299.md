> Tell me that I am not too old,

> to go search the city of gold;

> old age has not tethered my soul,

> tell me that I can want for more.


> My fingers are charred with coal,

> filling the bottoms of some fictatious bowl;

> dark is the night now and it's all I see,

> tell me that I can now grieve.


> Oh, also tell me if I shall ever be,

> what I dreamt at the crown of my tree;

> where I hung by for the rains to leave,

> and every drop vanished in an unknown creek.


> I will tell you, I have never felt such heave,

> having forced my brothers through the mind's sieve;

> now all the beauty that resided in the world,

> resides under the city of gold.


> Please tell me they can be unfurled,

> Replace with me and I will lay curled;

> Dreams are your percussion, O Death,

> Play, as I take my last breath.
