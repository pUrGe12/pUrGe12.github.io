>A masked man slowed down and offered his hand;

>Of all the stars in his coat only one shone,

> Collapsed under his weight the earth borne;

> Witnessing the light, I reached for his band,

> Up I went, and never came back.


> Slowly I found him talking to those,

> Of whom I was warned to disregard the most.

> Peers and vigilantes and thieves who scored,

> Nothing but a pint of the bottom soul.

> And we all sang the songs of the shore,

> As we sailed by and wished for more. 


Reused a few lines from a previous poem. Fits nicely here. Noted.
