> I met with the god of lust,
> inviting me in his compounding sum,
> of souls who tried to pave the way,
> tried, killed and died to pay,
> alas, being the one to go astray.

> For the pact didn't clear the sky,
> or fill the air with the goddess' smile,
> nor did it hammer a direction in the soul,
> enkindled us but one a mole.

> Oh to be, you must first face,
> the daggers of your own disgrace.
> The God invites not all, but you,
> lose sight and you lose yourself too.
