> too many have faced what they call fear,
> to cower and shudder with no one to hear,
> brethren and foe kill all those who are dear,
> in the dark alley, not in the night, but near,
> anything that is holy, is a disgrace, to
> be the one, the first, to shed a tear.

> no amount of liquid red can cure their happy smiles,
> time flies but not without the smirk in their cries,
> folding like paper these heathens, when called their lies,
> folded and tattered like the man on the aisles,
> of the narrowing road floating in my mind,
> heal or not it never flies.

> They will hold you in their arms and grace you with guns,
> think of them as mothers giving birth to children for fun,
> it never stops at just the first suckle, those buns
> baked but not eaten for fear hides in the trunk,

> Up it wants to come, god says let it be, pay me,
> worship me, cry to me, but don't hope from me.
> All in heaven and below, the papers crumbled lie in the bins,
> no one cares until the garbage man comes, then they shout "let him suffer a little more for our sins".
