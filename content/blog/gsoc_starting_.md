# The beginnings

I have used git for quite some time now and I was spending most of my day staring at my screen working on things. Now seems like the right time to step up with game and start making contributions to projects that people `actually use` already.

Its harder to get a whole new thing working from scratch but that is what I will do eventually and the only way to learn about managing big repos and resolving issues is to start making OpenSource contributions. I have talked to a couple of guys and apparently there is GSoC applications coming up soon. I am thinking of applying.

---

Alright, this is day 2 of my deep dive into OpenSource. Its not that I have never made contributions, but only that I never specifically searched for issues and tried to solve them (most of my contributions were fixing the issues that I myself faced while using the app). Its a fun thing.

I don't want to make a lot of the details public yet, at least until the application phase ends.

---

This is day 3, I got my first PR merged, after having made around 5 in the last 3 days, with 2 issues and multiple comments regarding code updates. I will try and focus on different repos too along with 1 proper issue in the one repo I want to get in with.

---

Alright, day 8 today.

I have made some contributions, raised issues etc. The org is mostly dead man and it takes so much time to do anything! I really want to make this a faster process.

---

Today I worked on a big parser, trying to update it to ensure the latest data format is matched. Let's hope it works well.

---

Yes, day 11 (11th Feb, coincidence?) I guess. Went out to meet a friend. Apparently there is a `prom` tonight. I don't have no one but that's not stopping me from having my fun. I saw a bunch of cucks wait in all black suits outside the girls' hostels. Its just so fucking sad, waiting for your girl to show up in a pretty dress, waiting alongside 100 other boys all wearing the same, looking the same, being the same. 

There is nothing that stands them out.

I pushed a PR fixing an output report for a scanner. The mod said do it in a different way and don't change the main functionality for a single scan, so I did that. Then I did the same thing for another and released a PR. So far so good. Let's see. 

---

Day 13 or 14. Added my first new functionality to the codebase and released a PR. BTW the previous one got merged. one step at a time. I made the bug fixes to this one and a previous PR in defect dojo for a parser upgrade. This one's fixes worked, hopefully the docker doesn't show cock in the other one! I am bored now. I will make the documentation for the project proposal for Cysec. 

---

Made a bunch of PRs yesterday, 1 more got merged. Told the moderator on slack to check my PR for the new feature in nettacker. Let's see how it goes, it's been a day, he hasn't reached back.

He subtly hinted on implementing a version scanner along with normal port detection so I am now working on that. It's pretty crazy stuff, trying to imitate nmap as much as possible. 

---

Day 16 or something I guess. 

Bruh this takes so much time! He said he'll review today but I am still waiting (granted the afternoon just started in London) but come on man. 

I have a good idea about what I wanna do next. I am trying to get two big things working

1. Path building in URL during directory scans
2. Version detection for port scanning

---

New day!

Alright so didn't do much today. Cause I have 2 quizes today. Made some fixes for the drone security sheet, including formatting the table in markdown.
