# The beginnings

I have used git for quite some time now and I was spending most of my day staring at my screen working on things. Now seems like the right time to step up with game and start making contributions to projects that people `actually use` already.

Its harder to get a whole new thing working from scratch but that is what I will do eventually and the only way to learn about managing big repos and resolving issues is to start making OpenSource contributions. I have talked to a couple of guys and apparently there is GSoC applications coming up soon. I am thinking of applying.

Alright, this is day 2 of my deep dive into OpenSource. Its not that I have never made contributions, but only that I never specifically searched for issues and tried to solve them (most of my contributions were fixing the issues that I myself faced while using the app). Its a fun thing.

I don't want to make a lot of the details public yet, at least until the application phase ends.

This is day 3, I got my first PR merged, after having made around 5 in the last 3 days, with 2 issues and multiple comments regarding code updates. I will try and focus on different repos too along with 1 proper issue in the one repo I want to get in with.
