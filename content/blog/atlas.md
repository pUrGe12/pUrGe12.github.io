Hello...

I am building Atlas. Its THE intelligence people think about when they hear the words: "Artificial Intelligence".

I will be updating this blog regularly with a few details here. I hope to have my product ready by the end of the year. That's when I start testing and making a database. Let's see how big I can make this

### Phase 1

0. A high level overview for the architecture is compeleted. There remains additional models for in-grain processing.

Think of these like the different parts of your brain working on different aspects and serving you at different times

1. [ReAct loop](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react) ready. This is the central brain, the one that dictates. I know that's not how the brain works exactly but...

The central brain talks to the other parts of the brain. It tells them what needs to be done. The parts process the available info and figure out the best way to do it (and who should do it). They employ their senses, their eyes, ears etc. to do the job for them.

Yeah, this is a beautiful way to put it. I will attach a diagram soon in my gallery!

2. Two tools ready. Modularity is at its peak. Atlas now has a logo
