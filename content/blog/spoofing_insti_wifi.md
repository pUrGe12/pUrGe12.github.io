My college has LDAP credentials that we supposed to use to get access to the ethernet. There is a `netaccess.iitm.ac.in` page that asks for these creds whenever you login to a new network. Now if multiple people are connected to the same network and anyone person also authenticates, everyone gets access. Its weird, but thats not why we are here.

# Idea

# Code

# Supabase

- Add the credentials to supabase
