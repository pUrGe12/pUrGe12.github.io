Hello there reader :wave:! Checking emoji working. Copy pasting content.

# A little introduction
I am Stijn A.K.A the TeaDrinkingProgrammer and you are currently reading the first blog post on my new blog! On this blog you are probably going to see posts about one of my main interests: cultures and languages, music and programming. The main content is probably going to be programming related, but some cross-overs are possible. In the programming space, I mainly follow developments in the FOSS space (I am writing this on [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) and Fedora Linux) and I sometimes play around with new technologies that interest me, like Rust or Svelte.
