6th May, 2025

I feel like I have been living under a rock till now. Before the start of Feb I had absolutely no idea I would be spending the next 3 months grinding like a madman for opensouce contributions. I will admit, I started because I wanted to get with GSoC. Now its more about the love for it than anything else. I will be getting my GSoC result day after tomorrow and honestly I can't wait. I know, its about the work and not the results (Bhagavat Gita), but damn, I do love it when my works results to something useful.

I spent the last few months studying the codebase for my project, making many PRs, feeling git and github up and personal (that's one way to put it, the other way is, sucking up to it). Its the most fun thing I have ever done, probably because this is the first time some code I write is being used for others around the world. You can never imagine this feeling until you have done it. Suddenly you have a responsibility, to write good code, so that people can enjoy whatever you create.

Its beautiful, and even though I made this my **major** top priority, spent 2 sleepless nights just coding and figuring out the hardest parts of my proposal (I basically implemented everything I wrote, to ensure feasibility and more that than, to prove to myself, that I can do it). At some point, I was so exerted, I was starting to feel panicky at the slightest noise and change in my enviornment, my heart would race faster and time would go by and I would still be typing on my keyboard and waiting for python to run.

Sometimes, things like that happen. I know its bad for my health, but boy I love the feeling of getting lost in something. Being lost is the best place to be.

The new motor controller and BMS have arrived from AUS today. I will go and admire them.
