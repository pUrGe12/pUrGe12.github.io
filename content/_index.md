Sup! Welcome to my website. I am calling this my `musings` as in reflections or meditations (directly borrowing from **Marcus Aurelius**). I made this website through a fork of the [tranquil](https://github.com/TeaDrinkingProgrammer/tranquil) with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) in order to serve two purposes:

1. A cool way to showcase my projects and interests to the public
2. A place to satisfy my hunger for writing articles and blogs on tech and non-tech alike

I am interested in `cybersec` and `hacking` so there is a special section in my blog where I post content on the stuff that I keep doing in that field. I also do AI and most of my projects are based on different applications of AI agents that I built, and some on computer vision. I won't go into technical details here, because that's what GitHub is for. You will find links in all relevant places so if my projects interest you then do check them out!

`wisps` is a special directory that I am the most proud of. As Mr. Keatings put it

> And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.

That's what `wisps` is for, a different perspective to life, a step in a direction that truly defines what being a human means. I am being dramatic, but its genuinely a fun place to be!

I felt this monotone theme gave a certain asthetic vibe to the website, for which I would have to thank the [TeaDrinkingProgrammer](https://github.com/TeaDrinkingProgrammer).
